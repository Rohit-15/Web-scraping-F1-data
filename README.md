# Web-scraping-F1-data

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Formula 1 championship race results using web scraping techniques like BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and SQL for data management. The objective is to create a dataset to facilitate strategic decision-making and derive insights into driver performance trends over the last 10 years.

## Background

Formula 1 racing is a globally popular championship event characterized by high-stakes competition among teams with cutting-edge technology cars. Data analysis in this sport provides a competitive advantage by enabling teams to develop strategies, track performance, and enhance future preparations.

## Context and Domain Knowledge

The scraped data will be valuable for businesses in the sports analytics industry, offering insights to constructor teams and drivers regarding consistency, team performance, and historical trends. Basic domain knowledge about Formula 1 racing is necessary to understand the dataset and determine what to scrape and analyze.

## Introduction of the Data Sources

The primary data source for this project is the ESPN website (https://www.espn.com/), which provides statistics, scores, and live match streaming for various sports, including Formula 1. This source is chosen for its legitimacy and comprehensiveness. While the official Formula 1 website was considered, ESPN offers multiple sports options, allowing potential adaptation of the scraping script for other sports in the future.

## Database Design Choices and Business Relevance

A MySQL database was chosen for its reliability, scalability, and robust relational model. The database structure consists of a simple table with columns for year, position, driver name, and points. This dataset allows for trend analysis, performance prediction, and potential development of predictive modeling for race winner prediction. The information is valuable for stakeholders such as sponsors, teams, and drivers to make informed decisions and enhance performance.

## Summary and Conclusions

This project demonstrates the application of web scraping techniques, SQL database management, and data analysis in the context of Formula 1 racing. By leveraging historical race data, valuable insights can be derived to aid in strategic decision-making and performance improvement. The dataset serves as a foundation for further analysis, including trend analysis and predictive modeling, contributing to the evolving landscape of Formula 1 racing.
